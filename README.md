# Monomal

My osu! skin for the standard ruleset.

## Build

Make sure that the `rsvg-convert` command is available
and that the font [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono) is installed.
Then, run

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec ./build.rb
```

To output an OSK file, run with environment variable `OUTPUT_FILE` set to the output file path.
